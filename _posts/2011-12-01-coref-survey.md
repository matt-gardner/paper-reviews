[This is an interesting survey paper](http://www.hlt.utdallas.edu/~vince/papers/acl10.html) that
gives a pretty good overview for someone who is new to coreference resolution. It's focused
completely on within-document, supervised coreference resolution, though he mentions a couple of
unsupervised models in passing (he doesn't ever talk about cross-document coreference). He spends
most of his time on the mention-pair model, because that's what has been used most frequently,
though newer models can currently get better performance. It ends with 6 1/2 pages of references.

The one thing I would have liked to see added to this paper was an overview of current challengies,
things people are currently trying to do (like cross-document kinds of things, or other newer
areas).
