Reading comprehension is a really hot topic in deep learning for NLP right now.  It's a high-level
NLP problem, and so is interesting just from a scientific perspective (how do we build statistical
models that can reason about a passage of text?), and it has some potential product applications.
There have been over 10 datasets released related to this task just this year, and dozens of
papers publishing methods for solving this problem.  The field is moving _fast_.

I'm working on applying reading comprehension techniques to answering science questions.  There
are some important differences between science questions and reading comprehension questions, but
also some broad similarities that make studying current methods and datasets for reading
comprehension useful.  I recently gave a talk at AI2 with a survey of all of the currently-popular
reading comprehension datasets, and some of the more popular methods that are used for this task.
Converting the slides for that talk into a blog post would be too much work, but I think others
might find the slides themselves useful.  You can find them
