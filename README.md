# Paper reviews

There are two purposes of this repository: (1) store BibTeX entries that I've used for easy access
later, and (2) be a good attaching point for a blog-like collection of thoughts about papers I've
read.  I wanted to write down those thoughts, both to clarify my thinking and to share the thoughts
with others.  A [blog on github pages](http://matt-gardner.github.io/paper-thoughts/) (attached to 
a repository of BibTeX entries) seemed like a natural place for that.
